\section*{Abstract}

The topic "electric motors" is a big and complex part of classes which students have to master, but the time it takes up is often prolonged by the lack of means, which help learning ones to visualize the working principles of these machines.

The aim of this diploma project is adding new means, as well as documenting already existing ones. This enables teachers to pick from a wider range of easy to use tools which they can use to convey knowledge and understanding to their students.

The result is a faster and more exciting learning process, which in turn frees more time to use by the teacher in the way he considers most helpful.
